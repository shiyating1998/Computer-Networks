How to run:
use the sender.sh and receiver.sh scripts provided to run the python scripts

./nEmulator <emulator's receiving UDP port number in the forward (sender) direction>,
			<receiver’s network address>,
			<receiver’s receiving UDP port number>,
			<emulator's receiving UDP port number in the backward (receiver) direction>,
			<sender’s network address>,
			<sender’s receiving UDP port number>,
			<maximum delay of the link in units of millisecond>,
			<packet discard probability>,
			<verbose-mode>

./receiver.sh <hostname for the network emulator>
			  <UDP port number used by the emulator to receive ACKs from the receiver>
			  <UDP port number used by the receiver to receive data from the emulator>
 			  <name of the file into which the received data is written>

./sender.sh <host address of the network emulator>
			<UDP port number used by the emulator to receive data from the sender>
			<UDP port number used by the sender to receive ACKs from the emulator>
			<name of the file to be transferred>

for example:
	./nEmulator 2939 ubuntu1804-004 7661 31849 ubuntu1804-002 46217 1 0 0

	./receiver.sh ubuntu1804-008 31849 7661 dest.txt

	./sender.sh ubuntu1804-008 2939 46217 test.txt
